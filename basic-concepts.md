# 1.1 - Algorithms 

An algorithm has ***5*** important features: 

***1. Finiteness*** - an algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps. Procedures that are similar to algorithms but do not necessarily terminate can be described as computational methods.

***2. Definiteness*** - each step in an algorithm must be explicitly defined such that the reader understands exactly what is happening. 

***3. Input*** - zero or more inputs. Received at the start or possibly introduced as the algorithm proceeds. 

***4. Output*** - one or more outputs. 

***5. Effectivness*** - an algorithm must be efficient in the sense that its steps can be computed in a reasonable amount of time, inputs are represented in a useable format, steps are digestable, etc. 

----

***Program*** - an expression of a computational method in a computer langauge.
